This repository contains customized nginx app which displays information about Europs's Top Five Football Leagues

Solution Implemented:

    To mount all static webpages a configmap named "index-html-configmap" was created. This config map contains html script for required static web page.
    To add customized config to nginx server a file named "custom_config.conf" is created and is mounted on nginx deployment config as configmap named "nginx-custom-config"
    These two configmaps are mounted on nginx deployment named "nginx-deployment"
    To end with, this application is exposed as NodePort via service name "nginx-service"
    The service is exposed on port 30007 and can be accessed as http://localhost:30007 from browser. 

Files Overview: 

    custom_config.conf : Contains custom Nginx configuration
    custom-html-data.yaml : Of type configmap and contains html script for static webpages
    nginx-deployment.yaml: Template for deployment of nginx server with required mounts
    nginx-service.yaml: Template for service exposed as NodePort to access Nginx server

Commands Executed to Get the application running: 

    create index-html-configmap:  kubectl apply -f custom-html-data.yaml
    create custom config for nginx configmap: kubectl create configmap custom-nginx-config --from-file=./custom_config.conf
