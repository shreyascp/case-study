processdetails.bash contains to bash script to fetch top nth (In this case top 3rd) process consuming CPU and Memory.

File Details: 

    processdetails.bash: Script to fetch top 3rd mamory and CPU consuming process
    top_out.txt: File generated during execution which contains contents obtained from executed top Commands
    output.txt: File generated during execution and contains top third cpu and memory consuming process

- More about output.txt: 
    output.txt comprises of three lines 
    First line will have headers for heach column in sequence PID (Process ID), Command (Process Command/Name), %CPU (Percent of CPU used), %MEM (Percent of memory used)
    Second line will have details of a process which consumes third most CPU in sequence similar to above
    Second line will have details of a process which consumes third most Memory in sequence similar to above


Algorithm for solution:

    Assumption Made: It is assumed that processes consuming third most CPU and Memory will not be same. So output will always have two Files

    Steps: 
        1. Get a snapshot of current processes using top command and dump the output in a file
        2. By default top command sorts process in decending order of CPU consumption so retrieve the third process (Third most CPU consuming process) and append it in output file
        3. Sort the contents of dump of top command based on percent memory consumption. 
        4. Retrive the third process from sorted data (Third most CPU consuming process) and and append it in output file
        5. Required process details are availble in output file.
